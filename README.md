# Barnga

### What are we doing?

The Barnga Project is an online card game that facilitates intercultural understanding. 

It works by giving each player a different set of rules and by banning verbal communication. Players have to then figure out a common set of rules to play by, communicating only through drawing pictures on a sketchpad. This challenging game mirrors the experiences of people from different cultures who may not share the same language. 

By placing this obscure game on the Internet, we are making it easier for social scientists to study interactions between people of different cultures.

### What do we need?

You! In whatever way you can help.

We need user experience designers, programmers, and most importantly: translators.

We'd love your feedback along the way!
